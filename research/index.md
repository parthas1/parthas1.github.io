#### I'm passionate about fluid dynamics, across the length and time scales they operate in - be it Stokes, intermediate or turbulent flows, and concomitant applications. I'm really interested in fluid physics, Numerical simulations of Fluid flows, Numerical Algorithms, High Performance - Parallel Computing, Flow and Instability Control, Aeroacoustics and Sound Control and possibly applying learning techniques in fluids. Thus the core of my present (and future) research is broadly in applied math, HPC, theoretical and applied mechanics and dynamical system concepts.
