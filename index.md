Welcome. 

I'm a graduate student pursuing <a href="http://mechanical.illinois.edu/">Mechanical Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My research is focused on uncovering fundamental fluid physics using accurate numerical algorithms, high performance parallel computing techniques and a multittude of techniques for data analysis. I'm also interested broad;y in flow and instability control, acoustics and applying learning/control techniques for fluid flows. 

An armchair thinker and a philosophist (a pretend-philosopher), I love anything remotely related to fantasy, mystery and conspiracy theories - I would definitely consider cryptozoology as an avocation. I also have a penchant for history and historical figures. I indulge myself in music (hard rock, progressive metal, melodic metal and more recently pop), TV Series (This list is enormous - my favorite ones include Seinfeld, South Park, Scrubs and IASIP) and occasionally quizzing. I love to code and learn new stuff along the way.
