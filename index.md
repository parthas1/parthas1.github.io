intro:
  - excerpt: 'I am a graduate student finishing up my doctorate in <a href="http://mechanical.illinois.edu/">Mechanical Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My research focuses on uncovering non-linear dynamics of viscous fluids, soft/rigid structures, and their coupled interaction using computational, theoretical tools. To achieve this I have developed novel algorithms, crafted high-performant codes running on massively parallel architectures which are then integrated with stochastic optimization/learning techniques for inverse-design problems.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am currently seeking opportunities.
