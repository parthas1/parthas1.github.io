Hi, I'm a fourth-year CS undergrad at IIT Kanpur. My research interests include Program Analysis, Formal Verification (specifically Automatic Program Debugging & Repair), Decision Procedures and Compilers.

Apart from academics, I'm passionate about Western Classical Arts, especially the Baroque, Classical and Impressionist periods, as well as Classical Music. 
I'm also a history buff, interested in studying the transitions between different cultural periods. 
I am also keen about systems programming, and I actively participate in online CTFs and Wargames to learn more about various systems in general.
