Welcome. 

I'm a graduate student pursuing <a href="http://mechanical.illinois.edu/">Mechanical Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My research is focused on uncovering fundamental fluid physics using accurate numerical algorithms, high performance parallel computing and a multitude of techniques for data analysis. I'm also broadly interested in flow and instability control, acoustics and developing/applying learning and control techniques in fluid flow problems. 

An armchair thinker, I love anything remotely related to fantasy, mystery and conspiracy theories - I would definitely consider cryptozoology as an avocation. I also have a penchant for history and historical figures. I indulge myself in music (Rock, Metal & more recently Pop), TV Series (This list is enormous - my favorite ones include Seinfeld, South Park, Scrubs and IASIP) and occasionally quizzing. I love to code and learn new stuff along the way. Reddit satisfies my everyday recreational needs, although I thoroughly indulge in the occasional travel and hike.
