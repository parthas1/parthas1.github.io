I designed and co-taught a course at UIUC—[ME447 : Computational dynamics and design of soft systems](https://mechse.illinois.edu/graduate/graduate-course-offerings/ME447)—at the intersection of stochastic optimization, soft systems/robotics and computational modeling for three semesters (Spring 2019, 2020 and Fall 2021).

The entire course is open-sourced and available online
with detailed description, content and lesson plans:

## Student testimonials

> "The instructor is extremely helpful and kind. He goes over the practical uses in the real world. This helped motivate me to understand the material on a much higher level."

> Provides plenty of examples to explain any doubts. Teja is very resourceful when it comes to coding knowledge. He is very patient and allows us to question everything and entertains all of our doubts. And he appreciates doubts which question even the basics and helps us work through them or at least leads us in the right direction for that.

> He is funny, I like that he does not take things too seriously and is free to make a joke in class. He also answers questions like a SAINT on discord. Saved me quite a few times by responding outside of class :)
