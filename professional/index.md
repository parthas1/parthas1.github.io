<p><small>I had several short stints in the industry as an intern. Without giving off too much information (IPR), here are some things that I worked on:</small></p>
<p></p>
<h3><u><a href="https://www.hul.co.in/">Technical Intern, Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL)</a></u></h3>
<p><small>	As a technical intern at HUL during the Summer of 2015, I was executing two projects. In the first one, I designed and implemented an indigenous automatic reel changing mechanism for soap tablet wrapping. The automation reduced the downtime from <em>41 s</em> per reel change to <em>4 s</em>. To give you an idea about the frequency, a reel change occurs once approximately per hour. I was instrumental in recovering <em>11000</em> $ per annum per line in direct costs. The design process was challenging - it had to be safe, amenable to ease in automation, work for all SKUs (fancy term for all type of products) and sufficiently future proof in all aspects - loading, cutting and splicing. I could initiate the roll out of this design across affiliated soap factories (with the help of a fellow IITM alumnus, who worked on tweaking the design after my tenure was over).

I also was responsible for investigation into and potentially solving the tablet infeed jamming issue. Soap tablets traveling in conveyors were getting stuck in line when being transferred to the wrapping stations. Using high speed camera images, image analysis, modeling and studying the machinery, I could come up with a root cause analysis chart that helped me track and solve the jamming (and associated) issues. By the end of my tenure, the incidence of the jamming issue was down by <em>86</em> % (controlled studies), allowing me to recover <em>6314</em> $ p.a. in direct costs. These projects were guided by WCM (World Class Manufacturing) principles. </small></p>

<h3><u><a href="https://www.forbesmarshall.com/default.aspx"> Winter Intern, Forbes Marshall Ltd.</a></u></h3>
<p><small>	I spent the Winter of 2014 with Forbes Marshall and was involved in the development of a hybrid cyclone separator and auxiliary components for the same. The primary goal was to come up with a design that could separate out wet dust, using only the intrinsic heat of the effluent gases, as opposed to conventional "dry" separators. We carried out multiple simulations of the aforementioned hybrid cyclone separator in STAR-CCM+, after iterative design in SolidWorks. The analysis called for an understanding of basic fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Another round of iterative design was undertaken for arriving at an optimal design , against orthogonal parameters of cost, capacity among many others</small></p>

<h3><u><a href="https://www.tvsmotor.com/">Summer Intern, TVS Motor Company Ltd. </a></u></h3>
<p><small>	TVS is an industry leader in motorcycle manufacturing. I spent time during the Summer of 2014 in their Hosur plant as part of the Operations team, responsible for maintaining efficiency in manufacturing. Working on the manufacturing process of engine crankshafts, I was given the task to reduce interruptions in the assembly line due to part variability. I could optimize the crankshaft manufacturing process through focused improvement of part and process design. By suggesting program and fixture changes after a critical review of the manufacturing methods, I could eliminate the scrap and rework losses due to the aforesaid variability, ensuring a cost recovery of <em>9300</em> $ p.a. The process capability (a measure of the process efficiency) increased from 0.6 (pre-correction trials) to 1.58 (post)</small></p>
